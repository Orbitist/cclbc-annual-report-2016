### Mission of the Chautauqua County Land Bank Corporation

Control and manage strategically selected dilapidated and abandoned residential and commercial properties acquired through the County tax foreclosure process, bank foreclosures and/or donations, and facilitate solutions aimed at stabilizing neighborhoods, encouraging private investment, and improving the quality of life throughout Chautauqua County.

### Overview

The Chautauqua County Land Bank Corporation (CCLBC) was designated as one of the first five land banks in NYS, by authority of the New York State Land Bank Act, in 2012. By 2016, the Land Bank secured over $2.86 million dollars in public grant funding, and leveraged over $1.65 million in private investment in the interventions of more than 173 vacant or abandoned properties in the county.

### Vacancy & Blight in Chautauqua County

CCLBC serves all of Chautauqua County, urban and rural, with its 44 municipalities and 134,000 residents occupying 1500 square miles in some of the country’s oldest housing stock. Vacancy in the county was reported at 22.4% in the 2010 census (including seasonal vacancy), almost twice the national average. Blight in the form of vacant and abandoned homes has persisted both as a result of the foreclosure crisis as well as from persistent economic and population decline across the county.

The Land Bank focuses on a balanced strategy targeting highly distressed neighborhoods (primarily through the demolition program), transitional neighborhoods (rehabs for stabilization), and gateway/main streets (rural rehab and demolition). Targeted parcels are prioritized based on local input and our assessment of where we can achieve the maximum impact.

Approximately 50% of CCLBC program funding is targeted in the City of Jamestown, the largest city in the county. Between 1990 and 2010, the number of vacant housing units there rose 36% according to the 2010 Census, causing Jamestown’s vacancy to rise to over 11%. Not only is there a critical need to remove blight from the city’s landscape, but there was a recognized need to stabilize neighborhoods that are falling prey to the insidious impacts wrought by vacancies and blighted properties.
