  <p>Each point on the map is a sample collected by Buffalo's water utility. Click on a point to get the lead test results and the year tested. The EPA sets the lead action limit at 15 parts per billion. Ten percent of the samples in any given testing round need to be above that limit to trigger action by the water utilty, which has not happened in Buffalo for the past five rounds. You can also search by lead test result, year sampled and ZIP code by using the sidebar on the right.  </p>
