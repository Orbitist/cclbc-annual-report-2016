<h3 id="mission-of-the-chautauqua-county-land-bank-corporation">Mission of the Chautauqua County Land Bank Corporation</h3>

<p>Control and manage strategically selected dilapidated and abandoned residential and commercial properties acquired through the County tax foreclosure process, bank foreclosures and/or donations, and facilitate solutions aimed at stabilizing neighborhoods, encouraging private investment, and improving the quality of life throughout Chautauqua County.</p>

<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>

<p>The Chautauqua County Land Bank Corporation (CCLBC) was designated as one of the first five land banks in NYS, by authority of the New York State Land Bank Act, in 2012. By 2016, the Land Bank secured over $2.86 million dollars in public grant funding, and leveraged over $1.65 million in private investment in the interventions of more than 173 vacant or abandoned properties in the county.</p>

<h3 id="vacancy--blight-in-chautauqua-county">Vacancy &amp; Blight in Chautauqua County</h3>

<p>CCLBC serves all of Chautauqua County, urban and rural, with its 44 municipalities and 134,000 residents occupying 1500 square miles in some of the country’s oldest housing stock. Vacancy in the county was reported at 22.4% in the 2010 census (including seasonal vacancy), almost twice the national average. Blight in the form of vacant and abandoned homes has persisted both as a result of the foreclosure crisis as well as from persistent economic and population decline across the county.</p>

<p>The Land Bank focuses on a balanced strategy targeting highly distressed neighborhoods (primarily through the demolition program), transitional neighborhoods (rehabs for stabilization), and gateway/main streets (rural rehab and demolition). Targeted parcels are prioritized based on local input and our assessment of where we can achieve the maximum impact.</p>

<p>Approximately 50% of CCLBC program funding is targeted in the City of Jamestown, the largest city in the county. Between 1990 and 2010, the number of vacant housing units there rose 36% according to the 2010 Census, causing Jamestown’s vacancy to rise to over 11%. Not only is there a critical need to remove blight from the city’s landscape, but there was a recognized need to stabilize neighborhoods that are falling prey to the insidious impacts wrought by vacancies and blighted properties.</p>

<p>The Chautauqua County Land Bank Corporation’s scope of work mirrors components of several long-term plans for the revitalization of neighborhoods, particularly in Jamestown and Dunkirk, but also along the main streets and gateways to our more rural municipalities. Jamestown’s updated Neighborhood Strategy will serve as the foundation of our targeting strategy there. That plan dovetails with their Downtown Revitalization Initiative (DRI) in which the land bank contributes through property acquisition, demolition, parcel assemblage and rehab in the Main Street (gateway) corridor. Our work in Dunkirk will be further informed by the city’s Housing Survey that will be completed in 2017. Our programs enact objectives detailed in the County’s 20/20 Comprehensive Plan and the housing strategies being identified in the county executive’s THRIVE initiative, which engages community leaders in the execution of strategies that support the Comprehensive Plan.</p>

<h3 id="highlights-of-2016-activities">Highlights of 2016 Activities</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Clearing of debris and regrading at the Portage Inn site in the Village of Westfield marks the completion of the $200,000 demolition. The historic inn sat vacant for almost 20 years after serial foreclosures left her derelict and unsafe. The Land Bank’s demolition funds were used to leverage an additional grant to build an access road and trail head for the Village.</li>
  <li>Westfield noted the 6th Rehab property to be sold through the Land Bank’s Sales 4 Rehab program</li>
  <li>Jim Caflisch, Director of Chautauqua County Real Property Tax Dept. is elected Chair of the CCLBC Board</li>
  <li>The CCLBC launched its new independent web site at www.chautauqualandbank.org</li>
  <li>The Land Bank moved to new office space at the Fredonia Technology Incubator in Dunkirk, NY</li>
  <li>The Land Bank embarked on a new project with Orbitist.com, a young geo-spacial data analytics and marketing firm located at the Fredonia Tech Incubator to compile and present data on county-wide housing, vacancy, blight and its impacts. Data will be tracked and used to inform the Land Bank’s strategic investments as well as its performance over time. Orbitist will map data and develop multi-media communications to highlight the resulting information for educational, marketing and advocacy applications.</li>
  <li>The Land Bank successfully applied for three grants, providing vital funding for operations, work force assistance and renovation subsidies for a new program that will cultivate responsible local land lords of quality affordable housing.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="outcomes">Outcomes</h3>

<p>Between 2013–2016, the Chautauqua County Land Bank Corporation secured two separate grants from the NYS Office of Attorney General’s Community Revitalization Initiative Program totaling $2.86 million. This funding has been allocated primarily towards activities related to demolition, vacant lot disposition, acquisition of bank foreclosed properties, administration and marketing (Refer to attached 2016 Financial Audit Report).</p>

<p>Through the generous support of the county Legislature, the Chautauqua County Land Bank has also demonstrated its ability to address blight and stabilize neighborhoods across the county through its Sales 4 Rehab program and creative problem-solving. The Land Bank’s programs will impact vacancy rates and property values, most dramatically in the cities of Jamestown and Dunkirk, where 62 properties have entered the Sales 4 Rehab program and an additional 69 have been or are currently scheduled for demolition. Rural townships participate receive additional resources from the land bank in project management to help these smaller municipalities build capacity to effectively tackle blight in their communities. The Land Bank is shifting the paradigm on how the county deals with tax foreclosed properties by leveraging resources to tackle the glut of vacant, abandoned and condemned properties.</p>

<h3 id="results-of-acquisitions-from-the-legislature">2016 Results of Acquisitions from the Legislature</h3>

<p>18 Rehabs Acquired, 12 Rehabs Sold</p>
